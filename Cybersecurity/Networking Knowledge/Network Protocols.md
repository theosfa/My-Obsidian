There are different types of *network protocols* that serve different functions to ensure efficient, quick, and secure network communication.
They can be categorized into following:
1. **[[Network Communication Protocols]]**
2. **[[Network Security Protocols]]**
3. **[[Network Management Protocols]]**

### How do network protocols work?

Understanding how network protocols work makes it crucial to see how connected devices communicate over a network. The most popular model, the [[OSI|Open Systems Interface]], demonstrates how computer systems communicate over a network. This seven-layer model visualizes the communication process between two network devices across seven layers.
