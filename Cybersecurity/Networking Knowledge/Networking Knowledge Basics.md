**Networking knowledge** encompasses understanding  the principles, technologies, and protocols involved in connecting and managing networks.
Key areas include:
- **[[Network Protocols]]**: Familiarity with protocols like [[TCP-IP|TCP/IP]], [[DNS]], [[DHCP]], and [[HTTP]], which govern data transmission and communication between devices.
- - **Network Topologies**: Knowledge of network architectures such as star, ring, mesh, and hybrid topologies, which influence how devices are interconnected.
- **IP Addressing and Subnetting**: Understanding [[IP]] address allocation, subnetting, and [[CIDR]] notation for organizing and managing network addresses.
- **Network Devices**: Knowledge of [[Router]], [[Switches]], [[Firewalls]], and [[access points]], and their roles in directing traffic, providing security, and enabling connectivity.
- **Network Security**: Awareness of security measures like [[VPN]]s, [[firewalls]], [[IDS-IPS|IDS/IPS]], and encryption to protect data and prevent unauthorized access.
- **Troubleshooting**: Skills in diagnosing and resolving network issues using tools like ping, traceroute, and network analyzers.
