A **Virtual Machine (VM)** is a software-based emulation of a physical computer. It runs an operating system and applications, isolated from the underlying hardware. *VMs* allow multiple “guest” operating systems to run on a single physical “host” machine, each with its own allocated virtual resources ([[CPU]], [[RAM|memory]], storage([[HDD]], [[SSD]])). This technology enables efficient hardware utilization, easier system administration, and improved security through isolation. *VMs* are widely used in cloud computing, software development, testing environments, and for running legacy applications. Hypervisors, such as *VMware* *vSphere* or *Microsoft Hyper-V*, manage the creation and operation of VMs on physical hardware.
