**SSH (Secure Shell)** is a cryptographic network protocol used for secure remote login and other secure network services over an unsecured network. It provides a secure channel over an unsecured network by using strong encryption to protect the connection against eavesdropping, tampering, and man-in-the-middle attacks. *SSH* is commonly used for remote command-line login, remote command execution, and secure file transfers. It typically runs on [[TCP]] port 22 and replaces older, less secure protocols like Telnet. *SSH* uses public-key cryptography for authentication and supports various authentication methods, including passwords and key-based authentication. Itâ€™s a fundamental tool for system administrators, developers, and anyone requiring secure remote access to systems.
