**Mesh topology** is a network architecture where devices or nodes are interconnected with multiple direct, point-to-point links to every other node in the network. This structure allows data to travel from source to destination through multiple paths, enhancing reliability and fault tolerance. In a full mesh topology, every node is connected to every other node, while in a partial mesh, only some nodes have multiple connections. Mesh networks are highly resilient to failures, as traffic can be rerouted if a link goes down. They’re commonly used in wireless networks([[Wi-fi]]), [[IoT]] applications, and critical infrastructure where redundancy and self-healing capabilities are crucial. However, mesh topologies can be complex and expensive to implement, especially in large networks due to the high number of connections required.
