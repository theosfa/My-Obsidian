In a **ring topology**, each network device is connected in a circular fashion, where data travels through each node in one direction (or both in a bidirectional setup) until it reaches its destination. This structure simplifies wiring and ensures a predictable data path, but a failure in any single node or connection can disrupt the entire network unless redundant paths are used. Ring topology is known for its straightforward installation but is less common today due to its vulnerability to network interruptions.
