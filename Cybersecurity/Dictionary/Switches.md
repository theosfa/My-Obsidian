A **switch** is a network device that operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the [[OSI]] model, connecting multiple devices within a local area network ([[LAN]]). It uses [[MAC|MAC addresses]] to forward data packets between devices, creating separate collision domains for each port. 
Switches improve network efficiency by sending packets only to their intended destinations, reducing unnecessary traffic. They support full-duplex communication, allowing simultaneous data transmission in both directions. Modern switches often include advanced features like [[VLAN|VLANs]], port mirroring, and Quality of Service ([[QoS]]) management. Switches are fundamental to creating efficient, segmented networks and are crucial components in both small office and large enterprise network infrastructures.
