**HTTPS** addresses these security concerns by adding a layer of encryption using [[SSL-TSL]] (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security). This encryption protects the confidentiality and integrity of data in transit, securing sensitive information such as login credentials and financial transactions. HTTPS also provides authentication, ensuring that users are communicating with the intended website. In recent years, there has been a significant push towards HTTPS adoption across the web, with major browsers marking [[HTTP]] sites as “not secure.” This shift has greatly enhanced overall web security, though it’s important to note that HTTPS secures the connection, not necessarily the content of the website itself.
