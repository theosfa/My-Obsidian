A **router** is a networking device that directs data packets between different networks, ensuring they reach their destination. It operates at the network layer (Layer 3) of the [[OSI]] model and forwards data based on the [[IP]] addresses of the source and destination. Routers are essential for connecting devices to the internet or linking multiple networks together. They maintain a routing table to decide the best path for data and can dynamically update routes using protocols like [[RIP]], [[OSPF]], or [[BGP]]. Routers also handle Network Address Translation ([[NAT]]), allowing multiple devices to share a single public IP address. Many modern routers offer [[Wi-Fi]] for wireless connectivity and include basic firewall security to protect the network from threats.
