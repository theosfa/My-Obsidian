A **DMZ**, also known as a **Demilitarized Zone**, is a specific part of a network that functions as a buffer or separation between an organization’s internal, trusted network and the external, untrusted networks like the internet. The primary purpose of a DMZ is to isolate critical systems and data from the potentially hostile external environment and provide an extra layer of security.
