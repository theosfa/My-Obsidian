A **star network topology** is a configuration where all devices (nodes) are connected directly to a central hub or [[switches]]. In this arrangement, each node has a dedicated point-to-point link to the central device, forming a star-like structure. This topology offers advantages such as easy installation and reconfiguration, centralized management, and fault isolation. If one connection fails, it doesnâ€™t affect others. However, the central hub is a single point of failure for the entire network. Star topologies are commonly used in local area networks ([[LAN]]s) due to their reliability, scalability, and ease of maintenance, making them a popular choice in both small office and large enterprise environments.
