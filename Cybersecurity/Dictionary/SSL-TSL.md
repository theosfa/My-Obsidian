**Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)** is a communication protocol, or set of rules, that creates a secure connection between two devices or applications on a network. Itâ€™s important to establish trust and authenticate the other party before you share credentials or data over the internet. *SSL* is technology your applications or browsers may have used to create a secure, encrypted communication channel over any network. However, *SSL* is an older technology that contains some security flaws. **Transport Layer Security (TLS)** is the upgraded version of *SSL* that fixes existing *SSL* vulnerabilities. *TLS* authenticates more efficiently and continues to support encrypted communication channels.
