A **Wide Area Network** (WAN) is a telecommunications network that extends over a large geographical area, connecting multiple smaller networks like [[LAN]]s across cities, countries, or continents. *WANs* use technologies such as leased lines, satellites, cellular networks, or the internet to facilitate long-distance communication. They enable organizations to share data and resources across dispersed locations, supporting remote offices and global operations. *WANs* typically involve slower transmission speeds compared to LANs due to longer distances and varied connection types. Key considerations for WANs include bandwidth management, security protocols like [[VPN]]s, and optimizing performance across diverse network conditions.
