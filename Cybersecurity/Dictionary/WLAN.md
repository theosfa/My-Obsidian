A **Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)** is a type of computer network that uses wireless data connections to link devices within a limited area. *WLANs* typically use [[Wi-Fi]] technology, allowing devices like laptops, smartphones, and [[IoT]] devices to connect to the internet or communicate with each other without physical cable connections. *WLANs* operate on radio frequencies, usually in the 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz bands, and are set up using wireless routers or access points. They offer flexibility and mobility within the networkâ€™s range, but require security measures like encryption (e.g., [[WPA3]]) to protect against unauthorized access and data interception.
