The **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)** is a network management protocol used to automatically assign [[IP]] addresses and other network configuration details, such as subnet masks, default gateways, and [[DNS]] servers, to devices on a network. When a device, such as a computer or smartphone, connects to a network, it sends a request to the *DHCP* server, which then dynamically assigns an available *IP* address from a defined range and provides the necessary configuration information. This process simplifies network management by eliminating the need for manual *IP* address assignment and reduces the risk of *IP* conflicts, ensuring that devices can seamlessly join the network and communicate with other devices and services.
