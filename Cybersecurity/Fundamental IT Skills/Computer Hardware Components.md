Computer hardware components are the physical parts of a computer system that work together to perform computing tasks. The key components include the **Central processing unit ([[CPU]])**, which is the “brain” of the computer responsible for executing instructions and processing data. The **[[Motherboard]]** is the main circuit board that connects and allows communication between the CPU, memory, and other hardware. **Random Access Memory ([[RAM]])** serves as the computer’s short-term memory, storing data that is actively being used by the CPU for quick access.

The **Storage device**, such as a hard disk drive ([[HDD]]) or solid-state drive ([[SSD]]), is where data is permanently stored, including the operating system, applications, and files. The **power supply unit ([[PSU]])** provides the necessary electrical power to run the components. **Graphics processing units ([[GPU]])**, dedicated for rendering images and videos, are important for tasks like gaming, video editing, and machine learning. Additionally, **input devices** like keyboards and mice, and **output devices** like monitors and printers, enable users to interact with the system. Together, these components make up the essential hardware of a computer, enabling it to perform various computing functions.
